Recreating the board game Clue in python

## Rules
This game takes after the majority of the rules of the original board game, these can be found here

The major changes are that you do not have to leave a room and then re-enter it at a later turn to make another suggestion in the room, 
and that there is no suspect or weapon tokens that get transfered to the room when a suggestion is made.

Arrow keys are used for movement of the player piece around the board.
Mouse presses are used for character selection, selecting an action to perform on the players turn, and for selecting items in suggestions and accusations.
